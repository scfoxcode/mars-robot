# mars-robot
Simulate multiple robots following commands on a 2d grid

## How to run
The only dependency required for this project is the python3 interpreter. You can download python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Alternatively if you are running linux, you can install using the command `sudo apt install python3`.

Once you have python installed, navigate to the root directory of the project where main.py is located and run `python3 main.py`. On some systems python3 may be aliased simply by "python", in which case you can remove the '3' from the command
